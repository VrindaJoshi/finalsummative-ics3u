ICS3U1 Culminating
-----------------------------------------

Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) is an interactive instructional technique whereby a computer is used to present the instructional
material and monitor the learning that takes place. CAI uses a combination of text, graphics, sound and video in enhancing the learning process.

My task is to create a CAI Application that would be used to teach students one of the computer programming topics covered in the course:
**Modular Programming - Objects and Classes**

From the perspective of the user, I envision my software to open up with an introductory screen that will introduce what the user will learn 
in this module. At the beginning, I hope to have the user create their own avatar, and then the program will analyze their avatar (its 
characteristics: the fields) to introduce the concept of objects. For the text content of the module, I want the content to be displayed in short
bite-sized paragraphs, with a next button at the bottom changing the screen to the next paragraph. There will also be snippets of code on most panels. 
Including a progress bar at the top will allow the user to see their growth in real time, and help them see how quickly they are learning! Every few
paragraphs, a checkpoint will pop up, with a challenge to check their understanding. A few examples of possible checkpoints: type in the missing code, 
brainstorm possible fields. These checkpoints will aid with extending the userâ€™s attention span, and the user will feel good about their little wins! 
My game will be Cake Artist! Cake Artist is a game on tvokids.com that I used to play when I was little. The objective of the game is to receive orders 
from customers, and to decorate the cake they want. The cake object will already be created, however I will have the user create an instance of their 
cake order, with the specified decorations. After they finish decorating their cakes, the user will have to deliver the cakes to the customer (get methods).
If the cake needs any last minute changes, the user will use their knowledge of set methods too. My final quiz will be like a google form, with around 10 
questions. If they pass the quiz with a 80%, they will complete the module and get a certificate!
